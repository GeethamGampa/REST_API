# REST_API
Works on REST API Framework

A RESTful API (Representational State Transfer) is an architecture style for building web services that use HTTP methods to perform operations on resources (data like users, products, etc.).

## Core HTTP Methods
### Method	     Purpose	           Example
    GET	      Retrieve data	      GET /products/
    POST	       Create new data	      POST /products/
    PUT	      Update entire data	PUT /products/1/
    DELETE	     Remove data	        DELETE /products/1/

## Why Use REST?

- Easy to understand and use

- Works with any language or frontend (React, mobile apps, etc.)

- Clean and standard communication using HTTP
